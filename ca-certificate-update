In order to make nexus_emulation on beech happy with new cert for alpha, we needed to update
the CA certificate for the issuer. I downloaded from

https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/InCCollaborate/InCommon+Cert+Types

the InCommon RSA Server CA certificate. It was in DER format, converted using

openssl x509 -in Downloads/InCommonRSAServerCA_2.crt -inform der -out InCommonRSAServerCA_2.pem

That file is added to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors and the certificate bundle updated:

[root@beech anchors]# update-ca-trust extract
update-ca-trust: Warning: The dynamic CA configuration feature is in the disabled state
[root@beech anchors]# update-ca-trust force-enable
[root@beech anchors]# update-ca-trust extract

This fixed curl and system perl, but runtime perl still broken.

Fix for late model perl:

export PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem

this overrides the use of the Mozilla::CA package of certificates.
